# Project2
This program is similar to the minesweeper game (instead of bombs, there are geese which are identified with a number 9; if a field with 0 geese around it is revealed, all the fields around it are revealed).
The only code written by me is in the mywork.cpp file - the other files were provided to me as a task.
